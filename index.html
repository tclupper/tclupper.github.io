<h1>Clupper.com web site</h1>
<p>After many years (more than I care to mention) of spending money at GoDaddy to host a web site that I did nothing with, I have decided</p>
<p>to have it point to my free Github site and host static content.</p>
<p>I will figure out another way to host the web calculator stuff. </p>
<p>I will also include genealogy stuff. </p>
